<h1>ft_printf</h1>
<p>Because ft_putnbr() and ft_putstr() arenâ€™t enough</p>
<h2><i>About the project</i></h2><br>
The goal of this project is pretty straightforward. You will recode printf().
You will mainly learn about using a variable number of arguments. How cool is that??
It is actually pretty cool :)</p>

<h2>Testing</h2>
<p>My ft_printf implementation passes all the tests conducted using Tripouille and Paulo-Santa's ft_printf tester. It's worth noting that my ft_printf project exclusively includes the mandatory parts and does not feature a BONUS section.</p>
